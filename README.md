# PersianSpeechRecognition-RNN-LSTM-GRU
This repository contains an implementation of a Persian speech-to-text model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) architectures. The model is designed to convert spoken Persian language into written text, enabling automatic transcription of Persian audio recordings.
