# PersianSpeechRecognition-RNN-LSTM-GRU

This repository contains an implementation of a Persian speech-to-text model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) architectures. The model is designed to convert spoken Persian language into written text, enabling automatic transcription of Persian audio recordings.
So, This project implements and compares different recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures – specifically, gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) – for Persian speech-to-text conversion.
